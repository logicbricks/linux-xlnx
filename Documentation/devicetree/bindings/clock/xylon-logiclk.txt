Device tree clock bindings for the Xylon logiCLK IP core programmable clock
generator for Xilinx FPGA devices.

The logiCLK IP core device contains six clock outputs which can be configured
independently through here described device tree binding.

See clock_bindings.txt for more information on the generic clock bindings.

Limitation:
One clock output must be set as "maximum precision" output, which gives the
most accurate frequency limited with hw input multiplier, divider and output
divider, in allowed frequency range.
Other clock outputs can give any frequency in allowed range, but with precision
which depends on hw input multiplier and divider, calculated for
"maximum precision" clock. Output divider is independent for every clock output.

In real usage scenario, any output can give exact frequency or frequency with
+/- deviation, depending on calculated hw input multiplier and divider.
Default logiCLK output frequencies are set with hw configuration parameters.
Hw configuration parameters are provided to logiCLK driver through device tree
configuration.

Required properties:
 - compatible: "xylon,logiclk-1.02.b"
 - reg : Base address with page sized logiCLK IP core address space
 - input-frequency: Input clock frequency used for generating output clock
                    frequencies
 - input-divide: Hw configuration input clock divider
 - input-multiply: Hw configuration input clock multiplier
 - input-phase: Hw configuration input clock phase
 - precise-output: Phandle to "maximum precision" clock output

Optional properties:
 - bandwidth-high: Hw configuration filter parameters selection
                   If omitted, low bandwidth filter parameters are used.

Clock output:
Required properties:
 - #clock-cells: Must be set to 0
 - divide: Hw configuration output clock divider
 - duty: Hw configuration output clock duty cycle
 - phase: Hw configuration output clock phase
Optional properties:
 - frequency: Default output clock frequency
              If omitted, output clock frequency is set according to hw
              configuration parameters.
