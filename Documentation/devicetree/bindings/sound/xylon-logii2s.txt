Binding for Xylon logiI2S RX/TX instance configurable I2S controller IP core

Required properties:
 - compatible: "xylon,logii2s-1.00.a"
 - reg: MMIO base address and size of the logiI2S IP core address space
 - interrupts-parent: the phandle for interrupt controller
 - interrupts: the interrupt number
 - core-clock-frequency: logiI2S internal core clock frequency

 - instance_N : logiI2S RX/TX instance where N is instance ID in range 0 - 7
   - i2s-clock-frequency: logiI2S RX/TX instance bit clock frequency
      If an instance is configured to be a clock master, the bit clock is output
      and it is derived from the core clock by using a prescale register.
      If an instance is configured to be a word select master, the word select
      length is determined by this clock frequency and required sampling rate.
   - fifo-size: logiI2S RX/TX instance FIFO depth in 32-bit PCM samples
   - almost-full-level: logiI2S RX/TX instance FIFO almost full level in
      32-bit PCM samples
   - almost-empty-level: logiI2S RX/TX instance FIFO almost empty level in
      32-bit PCM samples

Example:

	logii2s0: logii2s@40080000 {
		compatible = "xylon,logii2s-2.00.a";
		reg = <0x40080000 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <0 31 4>;
		core-clock-frequency = <100000000>;
		instance_0 {
			i2s-clock-frequency = <12500000>;
			fifo-size = <512>;
			almost-full-level = <170>;
			almost-empty-level = <85>;
		};
		instance_1 {
			i2s-clock-frequency = <12500000>;
			fifo-size = <512>;
			almost-full-level = <170>;
			almost-empty-level = <85>;
		};
	};
